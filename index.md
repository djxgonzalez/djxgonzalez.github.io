I'm a doctoral candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford University. I study environmental health sciences with a focus on how pollution from extractive industries affects reproductive health and contributes to health disparities. My research applies interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and decision science, and I conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru. I teach Shades of Green, a course that focuses on environmental justice using design thinking and community engaged learning, where we collaborate closely with community-based organizations in Northern California. I support diversity and inclusion as coordinator of the Frosh Scholars Program at Stanford's El Centro Chicano y Latino. I received a MS in epidemiology from the Stanford School of Medicine and a MESc in environmental science from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, both with a concentration in global health. My work is supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF), the Diversifying Academic, Recruiting Excellence (DARE) Doctoral Fellowship, and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
