I’m a doctoral candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford University. I study environmental health sciences with a focus on reproductive health, health disparities, and exposures to extractive industries. In my research I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and environmental science, and I conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru. I teach geospatial methods, environmental science, environmental justice, and academic skills for undergraduates. I serve in several capacities to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the sciences. Among other activities, I facilitate the Frosh Scholars Program at Stanford's El Centro Chicano y Latino and I serve on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee of the Society for Epidemiologic Research. I received a MS in epidemiology from the Stanford School of Medicine, a MESc in environmental science from the Yale School of the Environment, and a BS in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of California at Davis. My work is supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF), the Diversifying Academic, Recruiting Excellence (DARE) Doctoral Fellowship, and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.


## Research

My current focus is on whether exposure to oil production in California increases risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth and impaired fetal growth. In a [2020 study](http://doi.org/10.1097/EE9.0000000000000099){:target="blank"}, we found that for women in the San Joaquin Valley, CA, living in proximity to oil and gas wells was associated with higher risk of spontaneous preterm births. The risk was heightened for births to Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black women, and to women who had completed 12 or fewer years of education.

In a [2021 preprint](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5P32D){:target="blank"}, we found that oil and gas preproduction (drilling new wells) and production activities (increasing production volume) increased concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, and other pollutants. We conducted a quasi-experimental study where we compared U.S. EPA air monitors in California to themselves on days when wind was or was not blowing from the direction of wells, with varying preproduction or production activities. Adjusting for geographical factors, meteorological factors, season, and time trends—and instrumenting on wind—we found higher concentrations of air pollutants at monitors within 4 km of preproduction wells and 2 km of producing wells.

I also study exposure to mercury pollution associated with artisanal gold mining in Madre de Dios, a region in the Peruvian Amazon. In a [2019 study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108786){:target="blank"}, we found evidence of widespread mercury exposure among women of childbearing age, a group of concern due to the risks to fetal and infant health. Over one-fourth of participants consumed fish with high mercury contamination. Many participants expressed worry about mercury, but most had no knowledge of its effects. In forthcoming work, we examined exposure disparities and contrasting risk factors among a diverse group of Madre de Dios residents. We also found higher mercury concentrations in fish from mining ponds.
