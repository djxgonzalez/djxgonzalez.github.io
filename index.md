Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford University. I study environmental health sciences with a focus on reproductive health, health disparities, and exposures to extractive industries. In my research I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and environmental science, and I conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru. I teach geospatial methods, environmental science, environmental justice, and academic skills for undergraduates. I serve in several capacities to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the sciences. Among other activities, I facilitate the Frosh Scholars Program at Stanford's El Centro Chicano y Latino and I serve on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee of the Society for Epidemiologic Research. I received a MS in epidemiology from the Stanford School of Medicine, a MESc in environmental science from the Yale School of the Environment, and a BS in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of California at Davis. My work is supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF), the Diversifying Academic, Recruiting Excellence (DARE) Doctoral Fellowship, and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
