I'm a doctoral candidate in the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources](https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper){:target="blank"} at Stanford University. I study environmental health sciences with a focus on how pollution from extractive industries affects reproductive health and contributes to health disparities. I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and decision science, and conduct field work and population-level studies in California and [Peru](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935119305833?via%3Dihub){:target="blank"}. I teach a [course](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/courses/2019-2020-csre-125e){:target="blank"} on environmental justice using design thinking and community engaged learning, collaborating closely with community-based organizations in Northern California. I support diversity and inclusion as coordinator of the [Frosh Scholars Program](https://elcentro.stanford.edu/programs/academic-programs/frosh-scholars-program){:target="blank"} at Stanford's [El Centro Chicano y Latino](https://elcentro.stanford.edu/){:target="blank"}. I received a MS in epidemiology from the [Stanford School of Medicine](http://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html){:target="blank"} and a MESc in environmental science from the [Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies](https://environment.yale.edu/). My work is supported by the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details){:target="blank"}, the [Diversifying Academic, Recruiting Excellence Doctoral Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare/details){:target="blank"}, and the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962){:target="blank"}.
