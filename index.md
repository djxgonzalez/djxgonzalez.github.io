## David J.X. Gonzalez

## Bio

I'm a doctoral candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources specializing in environmental health sciences. I study how pollution from extractive industries affects reproductive health and contributes to health disparities. I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and decision science, and conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru. My work is supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship, the DARE Doctoral Fellowship, and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
