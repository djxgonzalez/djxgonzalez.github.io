### Frosh Scholars Program

I coordinate the [Frosh Scholars Program](https://elcentro.stanford.edu/programs/academic-programs/frosh-scholars-program){:target="blank"} at El Centro Chicano y Latino, a program designed to help incoming students adapt to and thrive at Stanford. The Frosh Scholars Program provides three layers of support to first-year Latinx-identified undergrads: a graduate student mentor with similar academic interests or geographic roots; a seminar focused on navigating resources at the university; and social events to build community. As program co-coordinator, my role is to recruit students, both undergraduates and graduates, design the curriculum, plan the events, and facilitate mentoring relationships. In the seminar, we discuss resources available at Stanford and issues related to identity and  well-being, with the aim of providing wholistic support. In the time I’ve served as leader, the program grew from 52 total participants in 2017 to 91 participants this year, the largest enrollment in the program’s history.

### Environmental Justice Working Group

The [Environmental Justice Working Group](https://www.ejstanford.com/){:target="blank"} brings together Stanford students, faculty, staff, and community members seeking to advocate for environmental justice-related research, teaching, and service at Stanford. As a member of this group, I attend regular meetings, help draft proposals for institutional planning, and support the work of other students and educators focusing on environmental justice topics. I have been involved with the working group since 2017.

### Graduate Recruitment and Diversity (GRAD) Day

[Graduate Recruitment and Diversity (GRAD) Day](https://graddiversity.stanford.edu/grad-diversity-day){:target="blank"} is an annual event for prospective students from underrepresented backgrounds to visit the Stanford campus, learn about resources, and connect with current students. As a student representative on the Graduate Recruitment and Diversity (GRAD) Day Planning Committee, I collaborate with faculty, staff, and other students to plan this annual diversity recruitment event. I facilitate social events to help helping build community among the cohort of prospective Stanford graduate students. I've been in this role since 2017.
