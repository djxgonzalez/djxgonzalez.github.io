### Wildfire Smoke Risk Perceptions and Adaptation in California



### Mercury Exposure in Madre de Dios, Peru

Recent studies from Madre de Dios, Peru, have found high levels of mercury exposure among the  population. Our objective was to assess mercury exposure, risk factors, risk perceptions, and knowledge among women of childbearing age, a population of concern due to risks to infant and fetal health. We collected hair samples and administered a survey among 200 women aged 18–49 years residing in Madre de Dios. We analyzed hair total mercury concentrations and examined associations between exposures and potential risk factors. The average hair total mercury concentration was 1.62 ± 2.54 μg/g (range: 0.01–30.12 μg/g), and 67 participants (33.5%) had concentrations above the 2.2 μg/g reference dose established by the World Health Organization. High fish consumption and less knowledge of mercury's health effects were predictors of higher mercury exposure. Most participants (86.2%) expressed concern about mercury contamination, but few (26.2%) had knowledge of the health risks associated with exposure. Many residents consumed fish species previously found to have low mercury concentrations, but more than 25% of participants reported consuming fish species with high mercury concentrations. We did not observe cross-sectional differences in fish intake among women who were pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of data collection.
