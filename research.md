I study how pollution from extractive industries affects reproductive health and contributes to health disparities. I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and decision science, and conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru. My work has been featured in the NPR, Al Jazeera, and the New York Times.

### Oil and gas in California

 For my dissertation at Stanford University, I'm focusing on two aspects of how oil production affects communities in California. First, I'm investigating whether exposure to oil wells during pregnancy increases risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Second, I'm examining the processes that resulted in racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to oil wells that exist in California today. This has broad significance, because an estimated 17.6 million U.S. residents live within 1.6 km of an active oil or gas well and previous research has found high levels of air pollution near wells.

These findings will be reported in a manuscript currently under review. I presented a [poster](https://djxgonzalez.github.io/research/201908_isee/isee_poster_final.png){:target="blank"} on this work at the 2019 annual meeting of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. In a follow-up study, I'm using a mother-matched design, a more rigorous study design that better controls for unobserved, time-invariant confounding attributable such as family medical history, genetic factors, and race/ethnicity. This study will provide more robust evidence of whether there is a causal association between exposure to oil wells and of adverse birth outcomes.

I use a mixed methods approach to examine processes that that produce disparities in exposure to oil wells, combining longitudinal quantitative analysis with qualitative interviews. I use retrospective data on drilling activity and demographics in California to examine how the racial and socioeconomic makeup of communities change after new wells are sited or old wells retired. I also conduct interviews among residents of oil and gas frontline communities in California, to collect oral histories and assess perceptions of risk.

### Mercury in the Peruvian Amazon

In another line of research, I'm investigating mercury exposure in the Peruvian Amazon. Madre de Dios, a region in southeastern Peru, has a highly active artisanal gold mining sector. Tens of thousands of workers in the region use an estimated 200 tons of mercury each year to extract alluvial gold deposits. This has led to mercury contamination in rivers and aquatic organisms, including freshwater fish, which make up an important part of the local diet, particularly for indigenous communities.

This project was a collaboration with the Madre de Dios Directorate of Public Health. We found that 33% of study participants had mercury levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) limit of 2.2 µg/g. We also found a gap between worry and knowledge: most participants (86.2%) expressed concern about mercury contamination, but few (26.2%) had knowledge of the health risks associated with exposure. I discussed this work in a December 2019 [episode](https://gogglesoptional.com/episode-298-heavy-metal-pollution-sneaky-bacteria-and-snowball-earth/){:target="blank"} of the Googles Optional podcast.

 I'm leading a related study to assess mercury exposure among over 1,000 residents of Madre de Dios, comparing exposure among four subpopulations of concern: residents of indigenous communities, workers in mining, females, and children. In an manuscript currently under review, we found evidence of exposure disparities, with disproportionately high exposure among residents of indigenous communities. Study participants with intersectional identities, i.e., those belonging to multiple subpopulations, had the highest mercury exposure.

### Other Projects

I'm currently collaborating with the [Wong-Parodi lab](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/gabrielle-wong-parodi){:target="blank"} to investigate how California residents perceive of wildfire smoke risks and adapt to smoke exposure.

As a Fox International Fellow at El Colegio de México, I investigated how an apparent black market in Latin America is subverting global efforts to control mercury trade. I wrote about my findings in an **[article](https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/treaty-does-not-stop-illicit-mercury-trade-south-america){:target="blank"}** in YaleGlobal.

As a master's student, I worked with the Yale Global Health Justice Project and American Civil Liberties Union to investigate quarantine policies in the U.S. during the 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In a **[report](https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/ghjp_ebola_quarantines.pdf){:target="blank"}**, we documented how these policies violated the constitution and impeded the ability of global health organizations to respond. This work was covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/health/ebola-crisis-passes-but-questions-on-quarantines-persist.html){:target="blank"}.

As an undergraduate, I contributed to a **[study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12414){:target="blank"}** examining nitrogen and phosphorous biogeochemical cycling in temperate forests. I also co-authored a **[study](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12363){:target="blank"}** of nitrogen cycling and microbial communities in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.
