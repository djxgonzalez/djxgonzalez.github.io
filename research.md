I study environmental health sciences with a focus on how pollution from extractive industries affects reproductive health and contributes to health disparities. I apply interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology, econometrics, and decision science, and conduct field work and population-level studies in California and Peru.

### Oil and gas in California

 For my dissertation at Stanford University, I'm focusing on two aspects of how oil production affects communities in California. First, I'm investigating whether exposure to oil wells during pregnancy increases risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Second, I'm examining the processes that resulted in racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to oil wells that exist in California today. An estimated [17.6 million](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783652/){:target="blank"} U.S. residents live within 1.6 km of an active oil or gas well, and researchers have found high levels of [air pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712001933?via%3Dihub){:target="blank"} near wells.

These findings will be reported in a manuscript currently under review. I presented a **[poster](https://djxgonzalez.github.io/research/201908_isee/isee_poster_final.png){:target="blank"}** on this work at the 2019 annual meeting of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology ([ISEE](https://isee2019.org/){:target="blank"}). In a follow-up study, I'm using a mother-matched design, a more rigorous study design that better controls for unobserved, time-invariant confounding attributable such as family medical history, genetic factors, and race/ethnicity. This study will provide more robust evidence of whether there is a causal association between exposure to oil wells and of adverse birth outcomes.

I use a mixed methods approach to examine processes that that produce disparities in exposure to oil wells, combining longitudinal quantitative analysis with qualitative interviews. I use retrospective data on drilling activity and demographics in California to examine how the racial and socioeconomic makeup of communities change after new wells are sited or old wells retired. I also conduct interviews among residents of oil and gas frontline communities in California, to collect oral histories and assess perceptions of risk.

### Mercury in the Peruvian Amazon

In a parallel line of research, I'm investigating mercury exposure in the Peruvian Amazon. In Madre de Dios, a region in southeastern Peru, tens of thousands of workers use an estimated 200 tons of mercury each year to extract alluvial gold deposits. This has led to mercury contamination in rivers and aquatic organisms, including freshwater fish, which make up an important part of the local diet, particularly for indigenous communities.

<img src="/images/camep_map.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="400" height="300" style="padding: 10px;"> In a **[2019 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935119305833){:target="blank"}** published in *Environmental Research*, I led an assessment of mercury exposure among women of childbearing age in Madre de Dios, with a survey instrument that investigated knowledge and perceptions of health risks associated with mercury. This project was a collaboration with the Madre de Dios Directorate of Public Health. We found that 33% of study participants had mercury levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) limit of 2.2 Âµg/g. We also found a gap between worry and knowledge: most participants (86.2%) expressed concern about mercury contamination, but few (26.2%) had knowledge of the health risks associated with exposure

 I'm leading a related study to assess mercury exposure among over 1,000 residents of Madre de Dios, comparing exposure among four subpopulations of concern: residents of indigenous communities, workers in mining, females, and children. In an article currently under review, we found evidence of exposure disparities, with disproportionately high exposure among residents of indigenous communities. Study participants with intersectional identities, i.e., those belonging to multiple subpopulations, had the highest mercury exposure.
