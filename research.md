### Oil and gas in California

<img src="/images/oil_rig.jpeg" alt="" align="left" width="225" height="300" style="padding: 10px;"> An estimated [17.6 million](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783652/){:target="blank"} U.S. residents live within 1.6 km of an active oil or gas well, and researchers have found high levels of [air pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712001933?via%3Dihub) near wells. For my dissertation at Stanford University, I'm focusing on two aspects of how oil production affects communities in California. First, I'm investigating whether exposure to oil wells during pregnancy increases risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Second, I'm examining the processes that resulted in racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to oil wells that exist in California today.

I found that exposure to oil and gas drilling was associated with increased risk of preterm birth, using a case-control study of 27,913 spontaneous preterm birth cases and 197,461 term birth controls to women living in the San Joaquin Valley, California. These findings will be reported in a manuscript currently under review. In a follow-up study, I'm on this work using a mother-matched design, a more rigorous study design that allows for the control of unobserved, time-invariant confounders attributable to the mother, such as family medical history, genetic factors, and race/ethnicity. This work will provide more robust evidence of whether there is a causal association between exposure to oil wells and of adverse birth outcomes.

**ISEE**, August 2019. I presented a poster at the annual meeting of the [International Society for Environmental Epidemiology](https://isee2019.org/){:target="blank"} (ISEE) in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

I am investigating processes that produce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to oil wells, with a mixed methods approach that combines longitudinal quantitative analysis with qualitative interviews. Numerous quantitative studies have found that marginalized groups in the U.S are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards., including racial/ethnic minorities, low-income populations, and their intersections. The majority of prior studies have been cross-sectional, with limited capacity to examine processes that produce exposure disparities. My work addresses this gap using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design addressing the question of how racial and/or socioeconomic makeup of communities change after new wells are sited or old wells retired. In a study currently in progress, I’m using retrospective data on drilling activity in California and demographics data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In a related qualitative study, I’m using methods and theoretical frameworks from social sciences to document experiences with oil and gas-related exposures among residents of frontline oil and gas communities. I am conducting interviews to collect oral histories and assess perceptions of risk among residents of three oil and gas frontline communities in California. The findings from these two studies will complement one another and may help with generating further hypotheses.

### Mercury in the Peruvian Amazon

I have a parallel line of research on mercury exposure in the Peruvian Amazon, also with a focus on public health and environmental equity. In Madre de Dios, a region in southeastern Peru, tens of thousands of workers use an estimated 200 tons of mercury each year to extract alluvial gold deposits. This has led to mercury contamination in rivers and aquatic organisms, including freshwater fish, which make up an important part of the local diet, particularly for indigenous communities.

In a [2019 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935119305833) published in *Environmental Research*, I led an assessment of mercury exposure among women of childbearing age in Madre de Dios, with a survey instrument that investigated knowledge and perceptions of health risks associated with mercury. The project involved a collaboration with researchers from the local Directorate of Public Health, with whom I forged a close working relationship. I found elevated mercury exposure among 33% of study participants and a gap between worry and knowledge: most participants (86.2%) expressed concern about mercury contamination, but few (26.2%) had knowledge of the health risks associated with exposure
