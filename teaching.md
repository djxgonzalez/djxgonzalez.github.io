I teach courses on environmental equity and academic career. I use the design thinking framework to connect students with community-based projects. I also lead workshops on geospatial analysis.

### Instructor of Record

**Shades of Green, Redesigning the Environmental Justice Movements**, Stanford University

Historically, discussions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the environment have been excluded from mainstream environmental organizations. relegated to the environmental justice movement, which often focuses on urban environmental degradation and remains separated from other environmental movements. This course will seek to break out of this limiting discussion. We will explore access to outdoor spaces, definitions of wilderness, who is and isn't included in environmental organizations, gender and the outdoors, how colonialism has influenced ways of knowing, and the future of climate change. The course will also have a design thinking community partnership project. Students work with partner organizations to problem-solve around issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
