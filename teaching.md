My teaching covers a range of topics, including environmental science, environmental equity, public health, geospatial methods, and how to achieve academic success.

### Instructor of Record

**Urban Studies 125: Shades of Green, Redesigning the Environmental Justice Movements**, Stanford University

Historically, discussions of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status in the environment have been relegated the catchall field of environmental justice. In this course, we break out of these limitations, and we engage directly with community-based organizations working to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the outdoors. Each week we discuss the environmental justice movements, defined broadly, and cover topics such as definitions of wilderness, representation in environmental organizations, colonialism's influence on ways of knowing, and the future of climate justice. In the community-engaged component of the course, we use human-centered design thinking to identify a problem space and iterate on solutions. Our community partners include diverse non-profit organizations and public agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. I have co-designed and co-instructed this course with a doctoral student from the Stanford Graduate School of Education each of the past three years. The most recent iteration of the course had 14 undergraduate and graduate students, and I will lead the course again in winter 2020. We have consistently received [positive feedback](teaching/resources/urbanst125_feedback_w19.pdf){:target="blank"} and course enrollment has grown each year.

**Undergraduate Advising and Research 56: Building a Successful Academic Career**, Stanford University

This seminar is the teaching component of the Frosh Scholars Program (FSP), which provides mentorship, community-building activities, and academic resources to Latinx-identified first-year students. As coordinator of the Frosh Scholars Program, I convene speakers from across the Stanford campus to share skills, resources, and opportunities with the Frosh Scholars. I have led this course every fall and winter quarter since 2017, with an average enrollment of 20 students per quarter. *1-unit course*

### Workshops

**How to Make Publication-Quality Maps with R**

A step-by-step walkthrough of how to make maps for scientific publications, including a workable example. View the [lesson](teaching/workshops/publication_quality_maps_R.html){:target="blank"} and accompanying [slides](teaching/workshops/publication_quality_maps_R_slides.html){:target="blank"}, and download [data](https://github.com/djxgonzalez/workshop-publication-quality-maps-R/tree/master){:target="blank"} for the example.

**Introduction to Spatial Analysis in R**

An introduction to the spatial features (sf) package in R, a powerful set of tools for geospatial analyses with vector data (points, lines, and polygons). View [resources](https://github.com/djxgonzalez/spatial-analysis-r){:target="blank"} for this lesson.
