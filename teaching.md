My work as an educator includes designing and leading

### Instructor of Record

**URBANST 125: Shades of Green, Redesigning the Environmental Justice Movements**, Stanford University

Historically, discussions of race, ethnicity, culture, and equity in the environment have been relegated to the environmental justice movement, which often focuses on urban environmental degradation and remains separated from other environmental movements. This course will seek to break out of this limiting discussion. We will explore access to outdoor spaces, definitions of wilderness, who is and isn't included in environmental organizations, gender and the outdoors, how colonialism has influenced ways of knowing, and the future of climate change. The course will also have a design thinking community partnership project. Students will work with partner organizations to problem-solve around issues of access and diversity. We value a diversity of experiences and epistemological beliefs, and therefore undergraduates and graduate students from all disciplines are welcome. [Here](http://www.leadershipcounsel.org/) is an example of student output. *5-unit course, Winter 2019*

**UAR 56: Building a Successful Academic Career**, Stanford University

Plan and facilitate biweekly meetings to teach students in the Frosh Scholars Program about opportunities and resources available across the university. *1-unit course, Fall and Winter 2017-2019*
